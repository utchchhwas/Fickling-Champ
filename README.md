# Fickling Champ
This game is created using the iGraphics library and OpenGL.
"Fickling Champ.cpp" is written in C. But as the project is in C++, the .cpp extension was used for compatibility.
The "Assets" file containing all the extra resources the game needs can be downloaded from the following link:
